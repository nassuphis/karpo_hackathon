# Root Finding: Ehrlich-Aberth Method

The core computational engine is a pure JavaScript implementation of the [Ehrlich-Aberth method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberth_method) — a simultaneous iterative root-finding algorithm with cubic convergence.

## How It Works

Given a degree-*n* polynomial p(z) = cₙzⁿ + ··· + c₁z + c₀ (subscript = power of z), the algorithm maintains *n* root approximations z₁, ..., zₙ and refines them all simultaneously:

1. **Evaluate** p(zᵢ) and p'(zᵢ) at each current root estimate using [Horner's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horner%27s_method) — this computes both the polynomial value and its derivative in a single O(n) pass per root.

2. **Newton step:** Compute the Newton correction wᵢ = p(zᵢ) / p'(zᵢ).

3. **Aberth correction:** Instead of applying the Newton step directly (which would be plain Newton's method and only converge quadratically), apply the Aberth deflation:

   ```
   zᵢ ← zᵢ − wᵢ / (1 − wᵢ · Σⱼ≠ᵢ 1/(zᵢ − zⱼ))
   ```

   The sum term accounts for the other roots, effectively deflating the polynomial so each root estimate repels from the others. This is what gives the method its cubic convergence and prevents multiple estimates from collapsing onto the same root.

4. **Converge** when max |correction| < 10⁻¹².

## Why It's Fast for Interactive Use

The key insight is **warm-starting**: when the user drags a coefficient slightly, the roots barely move. The previous frame's root positions are an excellent initial guess, so the solver converges in **1–3 iterations** during interactive drag (versus 15–30 iterations from a cold start). At degree 30, each iteration is O(n²) for the Aberth sums, making the total cost negligible compared to the domain coloring render.

## Implementation Details

The solver (`solveRootsEA` in `index.html`) uses:

- **Flat arrays** `[re, im]` for root storage during iteration (avoids object allocation overhead in the hot loop)
- **`Float64Array`** for coefficient storage (cache-friendly, typed-array fast paths in V8/SpiderMonkey)
- **Simultaneous Horner evaluation** of p(z) and p'(z) — the derivative is accumulated alongside the polynomial value with zero extra cost:
  ```
  dp = dp · z + p      // derivative accumulator
  p  = p · z + cₖ      // polynomial accumulator
  ```
- **Guard clauses** for degenerate cases: near-zero derivative (skip update), near-coincident roots (skip Aberth term), leading zero coefficients (strip before solving), degree 1 (direct formula)
- **Radius heuristic** for cold-start initialization: initial guesses are spread on a circle of radius (|c₀|/|cₙ|)^(1/n), derived from the constant-to-leading coefficient ratio, with an angular offset of 0.37 radians to break symmetry

## Bidirectional Editing

Dragging roots works in the opposite direction: the polynomial is reconstructed from its roots by expanding the product (z − r₀)(z − r₁)···(z − rₙ₋₁) using sequential polynomial multiplication — O(n²) complex multiplications. The resulting coefficients are rendered on the left panel and the domain coloring updates accordingly.

## Domain Coloring

When enabled (off by default, toggle via the ◐ sidebar button), the roots panel background is painted using [domain coloring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_coloring). For each pixel at position z in the complex plane, the polynomial p(z) is evaluated and mapped to a color:

- **Hue** = arg(p(z)) — the phase of the polynomial's value. Roots appear as points where all colors converge (all phases meet at a zero).
- **Lightness** = 0.5 + 0.4·cos(2π·frac(log₂|p(z)|)) — contour lines at powers-of-2 modulus. Zeros appear as dark points.
- **Saturation** = 0.8 fixed.

The polynomial is evaluated via Horner's method. The canvas renders at half resolution with `devicePixelRatio` support and is CSS-scaled to full size, keeping it smooth at 60fps even at degree 30.
